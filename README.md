Fusion is a game engine for creating graphical applications using the PySDL2 library and the programming language Python. It provides a simple coding interface for creating windows,
rendering graphics, and handling user input. It is and engine to create
games fast and easy!

### 💻 Development

Keep in mind that this project is in work, so if you want to see code,
then it is in dev branch but there is no 'full version' of this project!
We working hard to make first alpha version of it!

## 💾 Installation

To install our package, run this:

```bash
  pip install fusion-engine
```

Our PyPI package is at this [link](<https://pypi.org/project/fusion-engine/>)

If you want to run the example, then just run this command:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/dimkauzh/fusion-engine
 cd fusion-engine
 python examples/example1.py
```

For different examples, you change the number to the number of the example file

## 🗄️ About

Fusion Engine is currently (6/14/2023) build with Python and some Python libraries:

- PySDL2 is used for rendering and windowing
- PySDL2-DLL is used by PySDL2 for SDL2 binaries
- PyMunk is used for fysics simulation
- TKinter for UI
- Setuptools for PyPi package
- Json for storing data

This project began May 1, 2023. The original project began in C, but it's entirely rewritten in Python for it's big userbase and ease of use (productivity). This is actually also my EuroPython 2023 project.

## 🚀 About Me

A 13 year old game developer with much passion about game development. So I made this project to grow my programming skills and just make a tool that I can use for myself or a tool for other people to help them develop games.
