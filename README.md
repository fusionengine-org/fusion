## 🗄️ About

### ⚙️ Engine

Fusion Engine is currently (6/14/2023) build with Python and some Python libraries:

- Pygame is used for rendering, windowing, events and more
- Cython for compiling and speed-up
- PyMunk is used for physics simulation
- Custom UI library based on Pygame_gui for UI
- Setuptools for PyPi package
- Json for storing data

This project began May 1, 2023. The original project began in C, but it's entirely rewritten in Python for it's big userbase and ease of use (productivity). This is actually also my EuroPython 2023 project.
