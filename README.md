Fusion is a game engine for creating graphical applications using the SDL2 library and the programming language C. It provides a simple interface for creating windows, 
rendering graphics, and handling user input. It is and engine to create 
games fast and easy!




## Development

Keep in mind that this project is in work, so if you want to see code, 
then it is in dev branch but there is no 'full version' of this project! 
I'm working hard to make first alpha version of it!

First make sure you have everything installed, see chapter Installation.
Currently, in the folder example is a file called example.c. This the file where you put your code in and require the engine file. Later it will become a library, but for now it is easier to develop the engine like this To run it just run the run.sh


## Installation

Make sure you have these apps/libraries installed: SDL2.
Here is how:
  Go to [this website](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases) and download the version you need, and install it, more on [this website](https://libsdl.org/)

To get this into your project, you just get this repository into your 
directory by running these command:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/dimkauzh/fusion-engine
  cd fusion-engine
```

## Community
Our community is just growing, so if you want to help us with the project, 
it will be very helpful!
We have a discord server at this link (https://discord.gg/Smg3CK4ZMc)
Need to contact us? Just DM the Owner or CEO in discord and we will try to react as fast as possible

## Documentation

See at [The wiki of the project](https://github.com/dimkauzh/fusion-engine/wiki) (Still in work!)

## Future of this engine
Because this project only began 1 may 2023, we don't have a big progress because I, Dimkauzh am the only developer, and we have one person that is working on discord moderating(Finn) and BIG Thanks to him for doing that.

Our cool ideas:
  - Add lua to script with lua in this engine
  - Make a full GUI app (With something like GTK+)

## 🚀 About Me
A 13 year old game developer with much passion about game development. So I made this project to grow my programming skills and just make a tool that I can use for myself or a tool for other people to help them develop games.
